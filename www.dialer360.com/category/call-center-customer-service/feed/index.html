<p>The contact center industry has many KPIs that are necessary to monitor to boost productivity. Similarly, contact center shrinkage is the metric that refers to the time of agents that agents spend time of answer calls and serving customers versus the actual time they spend doing so. It expresses to you how much time agents devote to doing something other than serving customers.</p>
<h2>What is contact center shrinkage?</h2>
<p>Shrinkage is the essential factor of resource planning. It calculates the work time of agents when they don’t receive the calls even, they are present in the office. As well as the reason of don’t receive the calls is categorized as internal and external.</p>
<h2>Causes of contact center shrinkage</h2>
<p>Shrinkage is the factor that must measure in the contact center industry. It affects the success of the contact center because utilization of more time with receiving calls and help customers increase your business productivity. Meanwhile, when agents don’t utilize this time and don’t receive the calls due to other activities then it is difficult to meet your predefined goals.</p>
<p>Causes of contact center shrinkage are categorized in internal and external.</p>
<h2>Internal causes of shrinkage</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Projects work</li>
<li>System downtime</li>
<li>Training and coaching</li>
<li>Meetings</li>
<li>Spent time to help different departments</li>
<li>Unscheduled break</li>
</ul>
<h2>External causes of shrinkage</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Leave early</li>
<li>Late-to-office</li>
<li>Absenteeism</li>
<li>Sick time</li>
<li>Vacations</li>
</ul>
<p>Above all factors are caused to contact center shrinkage. Before calculation managers first analyze the reason for shrinkage. After that, they focus on the reduction method of shrinkage.</p>
<h2>Contact center shrinkage calculation</h2>
<p>Calculate shrinkage by using two methods.</p>
<p><strong>1)Number of contact center employees</strong><strong>2)Number of hours</strong></p>
<p>Let’s briefly describe these two methods.</p>
<h3><strong>1)Calculate in terms of the number of employees</strong></h3>
<p>The formula of calculating the shrinkage in terms of the number of employees is as follow:</p>
<p><strong>Shrinkage% = Number of employees needed to take calls/Number of available agents to take calls.</strong></p>
<p>Consider an example. Let us say that you required 100 agents to handle the call volume over a half hour to hit the target. Now, if at any point 30 agents are not available to handle the calls in this targeted time then the shrink percentage would be (100/70).</p>
<h3><strong>2)Calculate in terms of hours</strong></h3>
<p>The formula for calculating the shrinkage in terms of hours is:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Shrinkage% = Total hours (Internal shrinkage +External shrinkage)<br />
</strong></p>
<hr style="border-top: 1px solid #333; border: 1px solid #333; max-width: 55%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Total available Hours x 100<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Use the calculation method according to an industrial level. You consider which formula is best for which situation. The formula of the number of hours is best for measuring and analyzing the performance of agents individually. On the other hand, the number of employee formula is best for planning the manpower necessities for a campaign because this formula will give you the perfect buffer you should have while planning your manpower distribution.</p>
<h2>Is a high shrinkage rate impact the contact center proficiency?</h2>
<p>High shrinkage rate impacts the contact center proficiency because it minimizes it as well as reduces performance. To enhance the contact center efficiency, it is necessary to minimize the shrinkage factor. In addition, you cannot deliver the best customer support if the shrinkage rate is high. Moreover, the shrinkage rate is helping the managers to analyze the agent’s performance and know that how many agents are required to achieve the goal. However, it becomes indispensable for managers to monitor and track contact center shrinkage rates continuously.</p>
<h2>How to minimize contact center shrinkage rate?</h2>
<p>The managers can not enhance the contact center productivity and efficacy without minimizing the shrinkage rate. Managers must keep a robust strategy to minimize the shrinkage rate regularly. This strategy focused on the practices that help to minimize the shrinkage rate. Here are some practices that reduce the contact center shrinkage:</p>
<h3><strong>1)Understand the cause of shrinkage</strong></h3>
<p>Analyze the internal and external factors. Understand that which factors are reasons for high shrinkage. Further, based on this factor, plan how to improve this. Moreover, measure the shrinkage rate continuously because it maintains the workflow and you can accomplish your goal easily. Manage the fluctuations as well as identify all those factors that caused to increase this.</p>
<h3><strong>2)Improve schedule adherence</strong></h3>
<p>Make a schedule for your agents that helps you track their break time, in time, out time, etc. Achieve your target by scheduling your workflow is easier. You can identify the unnecessary activities that increase the shrinkage rate. Agents mention their time spent in other activities. Moreover, these time logs assist you to calculate the shrinkage rate. Send the report to your agents and the shrinkage rate is automatically minimized.</p>
<h3><strong>3)Monitor attendance time</strong></h3>
<p>Absenteeism and lateness are the big cause of increasing the shrinkage rate. If it becomes a habit then this is a serious factor. Arrange a meeting with agents and ask them for their absence reasons. Moreover, implement a strategy to increase agent efficiency by reducing lateness and absenteeism.</p>
<h3><strong>4)Engaged agents with work</strong></h3>
<p>Keep your agents engaged with work because in this way they have seated on their desk and chances of shrinkage are low. But never load your agents with more work because it increases the shrinkage rate. Keep them motivated and inspire them by engaging their work. Furthermore, make a team and assign work instead of assigning the work individually.</p>
<h3><strong>5)Give Reward</strong></h3>
<p>Only regular appraisals are not enough. Agents need to be some motivation to put more effort into your business growth. Give rewards to the best performers. They motivate and work excitedly.</p>
<h3><strong>6)Try variations</strong></h3>
<p>Don’t use the same method to track agents’ performance and ways to reduce the shrinkage rate. Try different methods to deal with people. Other than that, managing and monitoring the workplace is a critical part of your business growth.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To wrap up, analyze the employees and work strategies on regular basis to improve the business efficacy. Understand facts and try to resolve all issues that are caused to decrease your business growth. Contact center shrinkage impacts the productivity of the contact centers directly. So, apply the above practices to minimize the shrinkage rate.</p>

Suppose yourself as an agent working in a call center. The phone bell rings. “Trin, Trin.” You pick the call and listens to a blasting fellow yelling at you; &#8220;I am enough of you, just fix my issue immediately.” You start using the prescribed standard rebuttal tactics, but all in vain.</p>
<p>Does it mean that the standard rebuttal techniques aren’t useful anymore? No, standard prescribed tactics are still effective. Then why it doesn’t work? You may ask. Well, it’s the “customer type recognition” factor that is missing in your dealing.</p>
<p>Amazingly, there are various kinds of customers. So, you have to assess their type and then deal with them accordingly. Here we have put together some basic kinds of customers that an agent may face regularly.</p>
<h2>1.      The Chatty Cathy</h2>
<p>This kind of customer is fond of talking without pauses. So, if you start talking with them, they would take you to the Huawei for vacations, instead of the customer support that you are supposed to provide.</p>
<p>Therefore, be conscious and cautious about such talking toms. You should stay on track and don’t let them detract you. Ask close-ended questions instead of open-ended responses and ask them to talk shortly. Moreover, you should be focused and trying to close every chance of new or prolonged conversation.</p>
<p>Also, you can use scripted questions instead of asking detailed explanations. When you will use short and prescribed statements, your customer will automatically be compelled to answer briefly.</p>
<h2>2.      The Negative Nerd</h2>
<p>They are the most complicated customers in the world. They neither show satisfaction nor disappointment. So, it has always been hard to assess the accurate opinion that they hold about a product or a service.</p>
<p>How we should deal with such people? You may ask. Fine, you should keep a smile on face and don’t let them take you down. Also, help to resolve their issue as soon as possible. After that let them feel that they have worth for the company.</p>
<p>However, never forget to ask for feedback. This will allow them to express their opinions to some extent. You will be able to understand the whole story with the help of a few words that they have uttered.</p>
<h2>3.      The Mistaken Man</h2>
<p>At times, you have to face some customers who have wrong information about products or services. In this case, you have to deal so carefully, as telling them outright that they are at fault can easily irritate them. So, you should let them feel you as a partner in exploring the answer to their concerns.</p>
<p>This kind of customer insists that they know more and better than you. Certainly, they have obtained this information from wrong sources. So, when you will try to make them correct, they will resist you a lot. This is the point where you are required to give your best.</p>
<p>Here, be positive and listen to them. After listening to them, you should make a move. It should be polite, wise, and smart. Use tactics to tackle them successfully.</p>
<h2>4.      The Threatening Theo</h2>
<p>Threatening Theo is the disappointing kind who is good to go to detonate when he lands at the opposite end of your telephone. Ordinarily, this sort of client can be scarier than Negative Nerds and they may even take steps to leave your organization for another and pass some frightening comments.</p>
<p>Keep yourself cool and attempt to quiet the circumstance by giving some compassion, much the same as you do on account of angry customers. Make sure to grin, be a companion, and stay as understanding as you can? On the off chance that conceivable, offer pay and attempt to determine the issue inside the briefest conceivable time.</p>
<h2>5.      The Confused Customer</h2>
<p>Such customers are neither talkative toms nor negative nerds. They are just confused about some features of your product or services. So, you need not worry. You just have to listen to their concerns carefully and give them a helping hand. That’s it.</p>
<p>You can put them on hold, consult your manual, and try to sort out their issues. In case you aren’t able to resolve the issue, you should consult with any senior colleague. The last viable option is to refer the customer to your manager.</p>
<p>Sometimes language barriers, medium incompatibility, and communication distortions can confuse. So, consider all these factors also when eliminating concerns of a confused customer.</p>
<h2>6.      The Elitist Emerald</h2>
<p>Some of your customers will ask you to route their calls to managers. They consider that the agents aren’t capable of handling their complaints and concerns. So, they prefer to talk with managers directly.</p>
<p>For such customers, you should be polite and try to convince them that you care enough to resolve the issue. You can tell them briefly how you have handled such concerns previously. Also, let them know that you are qualified for the purpose.</p>
<p>This way may be helpful in less bad scenarios. However, if the customer is insisting to talk only with the manager, then route their call to the manager. However, don’t forget to make the customer calm and less angry before routing the call to your manager.</p>
<h2>7.      The Positive Customer</h2>
<p>They are the best yet the least in quantity. Some customers are positive and supportive enough. They talk straightforwardly without beating around bushes. So, you feel more comfortable with them.</p>
<p>You need to guide them properly and that’s it. Moreover, it would be necessary to provide them with the right information and guidance. Mere the better handling will win their hearts.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There are so many ways to handle different kinds of customers. However, we are sure that the above-mentioned customer types and handling guidelines would be enough for you to manage almost all kinds of callers.</p>
<p>So, whenever you come across a tough customer, just recall the types, handling guidelines, and imply within seconds. If you found a customer type that is not mentioned in this write-up, just do brain-storming, invent a solution, and imply it.</p>
